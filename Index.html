            <p>Some electronics and household appliances consume more energy than others. In 2021, there was a 20% increase in the electricity bill, and an additional fee of R$ 14 started being charged for every 100 kWh (kilowatt-hours) consumed. To save on expenses, understanding how the devices you use the most work, such as air conditioners, laptops, and washing machines, can make a difference in the end-of-month bill.</p>

            <p>Devices that convert electrical energy into heat, such as refrigerators and showers, are the ones that most impact the electricity bill. However, without conscious use, even items like computers and video games can weigh in at the end of the month. Here are the electronics and household appliances that consume the most energy in your home. We also spoke with the coordinator of the energy and sustainability program at the Brazilian Institute of Consumer Defense (Idec), Clauber Leite, who gave tips to help you save.</p>

        <h2>1. Refrigerator</h2>

        <p>Essential in our lives, the refrigerator helps keep food and drinks in good condition. For this, it removes its internal heat, transferring it to the external region. This transformation process is quite costly because it involves the conversion of electrical energy into heat, which consumes a lot of electricity.</p>

        <p>A common refrigerator, without being frost-free, consumes an average of 93 kWh per month - or, according to Enel's calculator, about R$ 80 on the electricity bill. Depending on its power and other characteristics (such as its motor type), this value may be higher or lower. In addition to its specificities, there are other factors that can impact this level of consumption.</p>

        <p>As refrigerators work to keep their interior environment at lower temperatures, when we open their doors, we change their internal balance. This occurs due to the direct exchange of heat with the outside. According to the coordinator of the energy and sustainability program at the Brazilian Institute of Consumer Defense (Idec), Clauber Leite, when done excessively, this action can weigh on the electricity bill. "If you open and close [the refrigerator] many times, changing these internal temperature factors, the refrigerator's motor will activate more times and, consequently, will consume more energy," he says.</p>

        <p>Therefore, according to Clauber, the ideal is to maintain a conscious relationship with the refrigerator, opening it only when necessary. Thus, for those who want savings, that classic story of spending several minutes with the door open, just staring at the interior of the appliance, should also be set aside.</p>

        <p>In addition, the expert also points out the conditions of the refrigerator. This is because, if the door gasket is problematic, the appliance will never really close - which, consequently, will cause even greater energy consumption. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to the condition of the appliance's parts.</p>

        <p>Clauber Leite also mentioned the thermostat, which must be adjusted according to the climatic conditions where we live. Thus, on colder days, for example, the refrigerator can operate at higher temperatures - which greatly helps in the end-of-month savings.</p>

        <h2>2. Electric Shower</h2>

        <p>Following the same logic as the refrigerator, the electric shower is another "enemy" of the electricity bill. The reason is simple: to heat the water, the appliance also needs to convert energy into heat. As the process is costly for the device, its energy consumption ends up being high as well.</p>

        <p>Electric showers usually have higher powers than refrigerators, remaining in the range of 3500W. Thus, if used for one hour per day over the course of a month, this device can spend an average of 105 kWh - that is, it would have an impact of about R$ 90 on the electricity bill. Depending on the power of the shower and the temperature used, this value may increase or decrease.</p>
